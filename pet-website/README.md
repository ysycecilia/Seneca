# pet-showcase

A front-end website. The main functionality is to showcase different pets’ name, age, photo and descriptions. You can filter the pets based on pet categories and age range. This is one of the assignments of our entry-level web programming course. 
Techniques learned and used: loading and filtering data using js functions, using html to display information properly on a website, using css to create and alter web design.

Honesty declaration:
I uploaded this as a demonstration of what I have achieved through my study program.
I intentionally eliminated the course name because I do not wish for this to be found by students who would potentially copy my solution. As I’m still also a student, this could impact me as well. If you are a fellow student, please do not copy this assignment in any way. You are welcome to contact me for help instead.
